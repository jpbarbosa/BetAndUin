 *     -> This is the first message sent when the server is up, informing
 *        the other server that it desires to be the primary server.
 *        Then, it waits for a response from the other server, indicating
 *        whether it is already the primary server or not.
 *        
 * I_M_ALREADY_PRIMARY_SERVER:
 *     -> Upon receiving a I_WILL_BE_PRIMARY_SERVER message, if it is
 *        already primary server, it will send this message.
 *        
 * OK:
 *     -> Upon receiving a I_WILL_BE_PRIMARY_SERVER message, if it isn't
 *        already the primary server, it will send this message. The use
 *        of this message is unlikely.
 *        
 * KEEP_ALIVE:
 *     -> Message used by the main server to inform the secondary server
 *        that it is functioning.
